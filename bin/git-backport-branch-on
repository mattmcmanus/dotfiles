# This script is used to backport all commits from the current branch to a release branch.
# It creates a new branch named after the release version and the current branch, then cherry-picks all commits from the current branch.
#
# Usage:
# ./git-backport-branch-on <release_version>
#
# Arguments:
# release_version - The version of the release to backport commits to. This should be provided without the 'v' prefix.
#
# Example:
# ./git-backport-branch-on 21.3
